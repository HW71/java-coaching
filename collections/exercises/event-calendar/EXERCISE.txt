Exercise: Calendar of events
===================================

In this exercise we want to store Events in a collection that allows
implementing search operations like "get all events before..." or
"get all events after..." in a very simple way.

Create a class that implements the EventCalendar interface, so that
the EventCalendarTest can be run successfully. What collection type 
provides the best support for the required search operations, and
should therefore be used to store events inside the EventCalendar?
